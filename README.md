# Simple_OOP_example

- A very simple example of how we can use OOP in Python,
- A simple Battle game, player vs Monster's 
- In this example you can see how to use: 
	-> __init__() method
	-> Attributes 
	-> Methods
	-> Get and Set functions 
	-> Inheritance
	-> Python random 

You can improve this project by adding: 
- Main class in order to automate the battle 
- A Menu so the player can have several choices 
- Some more powerful Monster's 
- MultiPlayer mode 
- Double attack: attack two monster's in the same time
- Time management: if the player doesn't attack in a time interval he/she can be attacked 
- Graphic interface
